Open each script to see basic instructions for use, and attribution. These scripts come with no guarantee of functionality.

**batch_segmented_wave_draw.script** draws a waveform (top) and textgrid (bottom), with boundaries overlaying the waveform, on a loop through a user-specified directory.

**batch_segmented_wave_spectro_draw.script** draws a waveform (top), spectrogram (middle) and textgrid (bottom), with boundaries overlaying the waveform and spectrogram, on a loop through a user-specified directory. The spectrogram is created automatically.

**simple_wave_spectro_draw.script** This script draws a simple waveform, a simple spectrogram, with or without speckled formant tracks, and both together. It saves all three output pictures in a user-specified directory.

**spectral_slice_draw.script** draws a spectrogram and a spectrum taken at a user-specified time point which is marked on the spectrogram. All objects apart from an input sound file are generated automatically. 

**spectro_pitch_wave_draw.script** draws a spectrogram (top), pitch trace, waveform (middle) and textgrid (bottom), with boundaries overlaying everything. Spectrogram and pitch trace are generated automatically. 

**vowel_plot_draw.script** draws an F1-F2 formant plot based on values supplied in a spreadsheet.

**vowel_plot_manual_draw.script** draws an F1-F2 formant plot based on values entered manually through a form.

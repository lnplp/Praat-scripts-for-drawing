Open each script to see basic instructions for use, and attribution. These scripts come with no guarantee of functionality.

**pitch_draw.script** draws a pitch trace (top) and textgrid (bottom), with boundaries overlaying the pitch trace. 

**spectral_slice_draw.script** draws a spectrogram and an LPC spectrum taken at a user-specified time point which is marked on the spectrogram. All objects apart from an input sound file are generated automatically. 

**spectro_draw.script** draws a spectrogram (top) and textgrid (bottom), with boundaries overlaying the spectrogram. The spectrogram is created automatically.

**spectro_pitch_wave_draw.script** draws a spectrogram (top), pitch trace, waveform (middle) and textgrid (bottom), with boundaries overlaying everything. Spectrogram and pitch trace are generated automatically. 

**spectro_wave_draw.script** draws a spectrogram (top), waveform (middle) and textgrid (bottom), with boundaries overlaying the spectrogram and waveform. The spectrogram is created automatically.

**vowel_plot_draw.script** draws an F1-F2 formant plot based on values supplied in a spreadsheet.

**vowel_plot_manual_draw.script** draws an F1-F2 formant plot based on values entered manually through a form. 

**wave_draw.script** draws a waveform (top) and textgrid (bottom), with boundaries overlaying the waveform.
